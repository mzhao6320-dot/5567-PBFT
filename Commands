### 2.1 Terminal Setup
Open a terminal window in the project root path:
```bash
cd 5567-PBFT-main
```

### 2.2 Start the Primary Node
```bash
python primary_node.py
```

### 2.3 Start Replica Nodes
```bash
python pbft_node.py P1 5001
python pbft_node.py P2 5002
python pbft_node.py P3 5003   # Byzantine node
```

### 2.4 Start the Client
```bash
python pbft_client.py 7000
```

### 2.5 Common Commands
In the **Primary Node** terminal:
```bash
list       # show all nodes
status     # show node status
quit       # exit the program
```


### 🧩 Case 1: Normal Operation (Deposit)
**Command:**
```bash
send account=alice,amount=100,operation=deposit
```
client: send account=alice,amount=l00,operation=deposit
P0 (primary): tx
P0 (primary): account=alice,amount=100,operation=deposit
Pl (replica): prepare yes
P2 (replica): prepare yes
P3 (replica, Byzantine): prepare to PO yes
P3 (replica, Byzantine): prepare to Pl yes
P3 (replica, Byzantine): prepare to P2 yes
P0 (primary), Pl (replica), P2 (replica), P3 (replica, Byzantine): progress
P0 (primary), Pl (replica), P2 (replica): ack commit
P3 (replica, Byzantine): ack to PO commit
P3 (replica, Byzantine): ack to Pl commit
P3 (replica, Byzantine): ack to P2 commit
P0 (primary), Pl (replica), P2 (replica), P3 (replica, Byzantine): progress
PO (primary): status

### 💸 Case 2: Normal Operation (Withdraw 20)
**Command:**
```bash
send account=alice,amount=20,operation=withdraw
```
client: send account=alice,amount=20,operation=withdraw
P0 (primary): tx
P0 (primary): account=alice,amount=20,operation=withdraw
Pl (replica): prepare yes
P2 (replica): prepare yes
P3 (replica, Byzantine): prepare to P0 yes
P3 (replica, Byzantine): prepare to Pl no
P3 (replica, Byzantine): prepare to P2 no
P0 (primary), Pl (replica), P2 (replica), P3 (replica, Byzantine): progress
P0 (primary), Pl (replica), P2 (replica): ack commit
P3 (replica, Byzantine): ack to P0 commit
P3 (replica, Byzantine): ack to Pl abort
P3 (replica, Byzantine): ack to P2 abort
P0 (primary), Pl (replica), P2 (replica), P3 (replica, Byzantine): progress
P0(primary): status

---

### 💣 Case 3: Withdrawal Failure (Withdraw 100)
**Command:**
```bash
send account=alice,amount=100,operation=withdraw
```
client: send account=alice,amount=l00,operation=withdraw PO(primary): tx
P0 (primary): account=alice,amount=100,operation=withdraw
Pl(replica): prepare no
P2 (replica): prepare no
P3 (replica, Byzantine): prepare to PO yes
P3 (replica, Byzantine): prepare to Pl yes。P3 (replica, Byzantine): prepare to P2 no
P0 (primary), Pl (replica), P2 (replica), P3 (replica, Byzantine): progressP0 (primary),Pl(replica), P2 (replica):ack commit
P0 (primary): status

---

### 🔄 Case 4: Commit Phase Conflict
- All nodes prepare *yes*, but some replicas abort in commit phase.  
- Simulates inconsistent commit/abort behavior due to Byzantine interference.
client: send account=alice,amount=l00,operation=withdraw
P0 (primary): tx
P0 (primary): account=alice,amount=100,operation=withdraw
PI(replica): prepare yes
P2 (replica): prepare yes
P3 (replica, Byzantine): prepare to PO yes
P3 (replica, Byzantine): prepare to Pl yes
P3 (replica, Byzantine): prepare to P2 yes
P0 (primary),Pl (replica), P2 (replica), P3 (replica, Byzantine): progress
P0 (primary): ack commit
Pl (replica): ack abort
P2 (replica): ack abort
P3 (replica, Byzantine): ack to PO commitP3 (replica, Byzantine): ack to Pl commitP3 (replica, Byzantine): ack to P2 commit
P0 (primary), Pl (replica), P2 (replica), P3 (replica, Byzantine): progress
P0 (primary): status
---

### ⚠️ Case 5: Crash and Recovery
**Scenario:**
- P3 (Byzantine) crashes, then recovers.  
- System continues consensus with remaining nodes.
P3 (replica, Byzantine): crash
client: account=alice,amount=|00,operation=deposit
P0 (primary): tx
P0(primary): account=alice,amount=l00,operation=deposit
Pl (replica): prepare yes
P2 (replica): prepare yes
P0 (primary), Pl (replica), P2 (replica): progress
P0 (primary): ack commit
P2 (replica): ack commit
P3 (replica): ack commit
P0 (primary), Pl (replica), P2 (replica): progress
P0 (primary): status
P3(replica, Byzantine): recover
---

### 🔁 Case 6: View Change
**Scenario:**
- Primary node (P0) crashes.  
- Next replica (P1) automatically becomes the new primary.  
- System continues operation under new view.
P0 (primary): crash
Pl (replica), P2 (replica), P3 (replica, Byzantine): view change
P0 (replica): recover
Pl(primary): status
Pl(primary): crash
P0 (replica), P2 (replica), P3 (replica, Byzantine): view change
Pl(replica): recover
P2 (primary): status
P2 (primary): crash
P0 (replica), Pl (replica), P3 (replica, Byzantine): view change
P2 (replica): recover
P3 (primary): status
P3 (primary): crash
P0 (replica), Pl (replica), P2 (replica): view change
P3 (replica): recover
P0 (primary): status
---

### 📍 Case 7: Checkpointing
**Scenario:**
- Periodically records the transaction state (e.g., after 1000 rounds).  
- Checkpoint logs stored in:
  ```
  checkpoints/final_checkpoint_<timestamp>.log
  ```
P0(primary):checkpoint
View all nodes'logs in checkpointslfinal checkpoint 20251110 231455.log
